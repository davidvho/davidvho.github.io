<font color="#4682B4">Hi! I'm David.</font>

<p>I like plants, microbes, and challenges.</p>

<p>I am a master's student at the University of Oregon, earning my degree in <i>Applied Bioinformatics and Genomics</i>. In addition to computational skills, I have experience in wet lab and field research. I have a strong background in education, management, and leadership development, which allow me to work independently and in teams. I currently work in the <a href="http://baumannlab.org/">Baumann lab</a>, working with big data on whiptail lizards and fission yeast.</p>

<p>Take a look at my <a href="/files/ho_resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.
