<h2><center><font color="#4682B4">Hi! I'm David from Portland.</font></center></h2>

<p>I like plants, microbes, and challenges.</p>

<p>I am a master's student at the University of Oregon, earning my degree in <i>bioinformatics</i>. In addition to computational skills, I have experience in wet lab and field research. I have a strong background in education, management, and leadership development. I currently work in the <a href="http://baumannlab.org/">Baumann lab</a>, working with big data on whiptail lizards and fission yeast.</p>

<p>Take a look at my <a href="/files/ho_resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>.

<p>Let's talk over coffee or beer.</p>
