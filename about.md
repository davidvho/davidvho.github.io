<p>I am a master's student at the University of Oregon, earning my degree in <i>Applied Bioinformatics and Genomics</i>. In addition to computational skills, I have experience in wet lab and field research. I have a strong background in education, management, and leadership development, which allow me to work independently and in teams. I currently work in the <a href="http://baumannlab.org/">Baumann lab</a>, working with big data on lizards and yeast.</p>
